---------------------
    Quick Start
---------------------
1. cd to the root of the gf_classify directory
2. Run GFClassify

        src/gf_classify -c -t 10 examples/fg_amoa_pmoa_bg.fna models/amoa.icm models/pmoa.icm models/bg.icm > gf_classify.txt

   This command runs gf_classify telling it to check the reverse complement of
   all query sequences as well as forward orientation and reject any classifications
   with log-likelihood <= 10 nats.  By default gf_classify writes results to stdout,
   results can be redirected to file with the > operator on the command line.
3. Summarizing results:
         
        cut -f 6 gf_classify.txt | sort | uniq -c

      The output should be (with the header value 'label' omitted)
       984 amoa
       10675 bg
       979 pmoa
       1 rejected
4. Sorting sequences by label

     scripts/sort_results.py examples/fg_amoa_pmoa_bg.fna gf_classify.txt

   This will create one file per label in the current direcotry containing
   all sequences with that label.

-------------------
   Directories
-------------------

src/      - Contains the source for GFClassify (score.cc and score.h) and a make file to build the tool.  
            In order to build GFClassify you must download Glimmer 3.0 from their website 
            (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer/) and edit the Makefile to point to the directory 
	    where Glimmer was extracted to.  Should compile on any platform with gcc (type make inside
	    the src directory).	   
models/   - Models included with GFClassify, currently amoA, pmoA, nifH 1-5
scripts/  - Helper scripts for testing models and processing GFClassify result files (biopython required for some scripts)
examples/ - Contains example sequence files

------------------
     BUILDING
------------------

Prep:
-------
To build gf_classify first download Glimmer 3.0 from their website and 
edit the file src/Makefile, alter the glimmer_dir to point to glimmer
root directory.

Compiling:
------------
Change to the src dir and type make to compile gf_classify.  The binary 
will be in the src directory (src/gf_classify).  

   cd src && make

No install option is included, you can run gf_classify from the src 
directory or copy the  executable to a directory on your path 
(ex: /usr/local/bin), or modify your path to include the src directory.

NOTE: Building gf_classify will trigger a build of Glimmer, if for
some reason Glimmer compilation fails the gf_classify build will
fail too.

--------------------
  Using GFClassify
--------------------

Using gf_classify:
-------------------

When run with no arguments (or -h) gf_classify will output a brief usage
message.

  USAGE:  gf_classify [options] <seq_file> <model1> [model2 ...]

The command line program takes a sequence file (in fasta format) and one
or more ICMs on the command line.  If <seq_file> is - gf_classify will
read sequences from stdin instead of from file.

Users may specify a classification  threshold (log likelihood must be >= 
thresh otherwise reject the input sequence) with the -t option.  The 
-c option tells gf_classify to consider the reverse complement of the 
input sequences.

All probabilities are reported in nats (log base e).


Building ICMs:
---------------

ICMs for GFClassify are built using the build-icm program in the Glimmer
package.  We recommend using a periodicy of 1 (-p 1) with build-icm.

For more detailed help see the Glimmer 3 documentation.

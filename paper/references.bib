        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Searching sequence databases is one of the most important applications in computational molecular biology. The main workhorse in the field is the BLAST suite of programs. Since the introduction of BLAST in the 1990's, important theoretical advances in homology search methodology have been made using probabilistic inference methods and hidden Markov models (HMMs). However, previous software implementations of these newer probabilistic methods were slower than BLAST by about 100-fold. This hindered their utility, because computation speed is so critical with the rapidly increasing size of modern sequence databases. Here I describe the acceleration methods I implemented in a new, freely available profile HMM software package, HMMER3. HMMER3 makes profile HMM searches about as fast as BLAST, while retaining the power of using probabilistic inference technology.</p>

@article{blast,
    abstract = {{A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.}},
